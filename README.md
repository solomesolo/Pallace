# Project Title
Pallace is the RnD project aimed to build the system for the complicated bone fractures detection. This part of the project dedicated to the abnormalities detection on the musculoskeletal radiographs on MURA and LERA datasets.
MURA and LERA (musculoskeletal radiographs) are large datasets of bone X-rays. Algorithms are tasked with determining whether an X-ray study is normal or abnormal.
# Motivation
Our goal is to achive the result close to the human-level persofrmance and then to incorporate the solution into the daily practise of the radiologists to help reduce the human bias errors and help to overcome the timing challenges that practical specialists face when examing the radiographs. 
# Environment


# Data
On the first stage of the project to train the model MURA and LERA dtatasets were used. Beside this, we also used the clinical radiographs from the Germany clinics labeled by the practical specialists (average years of experience of the specialists 10 years).
